# TawkToTask
After working 3 weeks in the Gap of my current office work it was too tough for me to work on this task. Still I have managed to complete most of the Requirements but not all of these.
It's true that I could have done better but I am in huge project pressure in my current office right now

General Requirements:
- All completed

Generic Requirements:
- All from 1 to 6 but couldn't complete number 7 for the time shortage

Github Users:
- All the 4 requirements have done

User List:
- From 1 to 6 done but number 7 is partially done

Profile:
- Couldn't complete all the requirement

BONUS:
- MVVM Architectural is followed
- Users List is done in Layout Editor
